#  Portfolio Website

A minimalistic, portfolio website built to showcase my 3 years of experience as a Computer Science student. The site highlights projects I've worked on — from web applications and UI design to mini-games powered by AI.

The design is inspired by contemporary UI trends, incorporating glassmorphism, smooth JavaScript transitions, and a sleek dark blue theme with complementary accent colors. Every section is designed to be clean, engaging, and user-friendly — reflecting both my technical skills and creative approach.
